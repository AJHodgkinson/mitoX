The methods described here are to accompany the study "Nuclear-genetic modulation of tissue-specific mitochondrial RNA processing contributes to common disease risk", published as...

# 1. Alignment of RNA sequencing data:



# 2. eQTL Generation:

- Infosheets were generated for each tissue type, containing information on DNA sample name, RNA sample name and any covariates being used for eQTL mapping (various models used).
- mitogwas was used for each tissue type to perform eQTL mapping with plink
