# mitoX

MitoX includes resources used to better understand the genetic archetectur of mtDNA-encoded transcript abundance and its releavnce to common disease risk, as pubished in... 

This repository contains the following:

1. Genetic score models for mtDNA-encoded transcript abundances in 49 tissue types from the GTEx project that can be applied to user datasets
2. Summary statistics for genetic asscoiations between nuclear genetic variation and mtDNA-encoded transcript abundances in 49 tissue types
3. A description of methods used in the above manuscript.
